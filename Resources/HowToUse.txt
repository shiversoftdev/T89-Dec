UI Version:

Simply drag and drop scripts onto the Script list or click the folder to load scripts,
then you can double click scripts to load specific scripts, and double click functions
to jump to them.

If you'd like the clear loaded scripts or halt the current task, simply click the X.

If you'd like save scripts, select scripts (CTRL+A to select all) from the Scripts list
and click the disk to save them. Cerberus will then save each one into a folder in the same
location as the exe.

CLI Version:

Simply drag and drop files or pass arguments using the command line. The Fast File extractor
does not parse scripts that it exports automatically, so when you run Fast Files through it,
you then need to go to the scripts and load them.
